# Pacman Minimum Path Solver

## Project Overview
This repository contains a **Pacman Minimum Path Solver** implemented using a stack-based Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. The goal is to help Pacman find the shortest path in a grid-like maze while avoiding ghosts.

## Features
- **Stack-based DFS** for pathfinding.
- Supports adding/removing ghosts as obstacles.
- Handles grid boundaries and invalid paths.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
3. Run the code using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
